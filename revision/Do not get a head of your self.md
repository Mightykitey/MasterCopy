SO WHAT ask me self at the end of an statement



Wider narrow for the legal stuff



6marks for have 4 good lists

**A fully normalized database to 3 normal form**

no repeating data redundant data





TASK 1 DESIGN



interface design



Fun-

non fun-



justify why even if im repeating me self



colour scheme



images with alt text to tell what it is if not loaded



It is not final



do not give psodo code that going to appear and tell why we are doing it



stick we a design



comment to make it sound that it not made in development



why is it in a common



Reusable, sustainable make it bold like it punching the marker





audit table is for security so we know how was on line and what they did and we can IP search

TASK 2 Solutions



Friday



submit the last task on teams





first thing I must do is to open a test table and every time I look at my code write it down on the test table





FUNCTIONALITY/CODE ORGANISTION/LEGAL \& REGULATORY GUIDELINES \& STANDARDS/TESTING



We use 4 languages



testing table will drive it(We are showing the proses)



code it easily maintainable by a third party--file name make sense and logical organisation, and is commented





accessibility



compatibility



legal and ethical considerations



security controls to ensure confidentiality integrity
